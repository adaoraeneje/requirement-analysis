# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to document the process and importance of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It contains explanations, examples, diagrams, and key steps involved in gathering and analyzing software requirements for a booking system project.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, understanding, and documenting what a software system should do before any development begins. It involves gathering detailed information from stakeholders, such as clients, end-users, and project managers, to understand their needs and expectations for the software product.

This step ensures that everyone involved has a clear and shared understanding of the system’s goals, features, and limitations. By analyzing the requirements early, development teams can avoid costly mistakes, misunderstandings, and scope creep later in the project.

### Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical stages in the SDLC. It serves as the foundation for all other phases such as design, development, testing, and deployment. A well-done requirement analysis helps:

- Ensure that the final software meets the user’s needs.
- Define clear project scope and boundaries.
- Reduce development time and rework.
- Improve communication between stakeholders and developers.
- Make accurate cost and timeline estimations.

Without proper requirement analysis, the project is at risk of failure due to unclear goals, missed functionalities, or unexpected issues.
